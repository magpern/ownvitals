# Status

Kept by the Architect and updated on every merge and every orchestration cycle. The
specification is [roadmap.md](roadmap.md); GitHub milestones and issues hold the detail. Status
levels (D10): agents set **IMPLEMENTED** only; **INTEGRATION_VERIFIED** and
**PRODUCTION_READY** are the owner's.

## Milestones

|---|---|---|---|
| M0 | Platform | in progress: bootstrap (#1) under review; issues #2–#16 planned | — |
| M1 | Withings core | not started; issues planned after M0's foundations merge | — |
| M2 | Home deploy (early) | not started; mostly owner actions (see "Blocked on the owner") | — |
| M3 | Identity additions | not started | — |
| M4 | Analysis v1 | not started | — |
| M5 | ECG & nerve health | not started | — |
| M6 | MVP UI | not started | — |
| M7 | AI & reports | not started | — |
| M8 | Beyond-household gate | owner-gated | — |

## Shared-file locks

No two open PRs change the same file. Files many issues need are locked here by the Architect;
an issue that needs a locked file waits for the holder's merge, then updates its branch.

| File | Held by |
|---|---|
| `.github/workflows/ci.yml` | — |
| `backend/src/ownvitals/config.py` | — |
| `backend/pyproject.toml`, `backend/uv.lock` | — |
| `backend/src/ownvitals/cli.py` | — |
| `compose.yaml` | — |
| `Dockerfile` | — |
| `AGENTS.md` | — |

Alembic migrations: a PR takes the next free revision number when it opens; if another
migration merges first, it renumbers and re-chains on its update, which needs a fresh scoped
review.

## Completed

- 2026-10-31: specification Revision 3 frozen at `635901d` ([roadmap.md](roadmap.md)).

## Blocked on the owner

Nothing blocks M0. These are needed later; agents work past them with fakes and record the
assumptions below.

| Item | Needed for | Owner action |
|---|---|---|
| Withings developer app (callback `https://withings.pernemark.se/...`, HTTPS on 443) | M1 live, M2 | Register the app; put the client id and secret on the home server only |
| Google OAuth client for sign-in | M2 live sign-in | Create the OAuth client; secret on the home server only |
| SWAG `site-confs/ownvitals.conf`, Cloudflare DNS, SSL Full (strict), WAF skip rule for `/api/webhooks/withings/*` | M2 | Apply on 192.168.1.151 and Cloudflare |
| `ownvitals-deploy` user with the forced-command key on 192.168.1.222 | M2 | Create the user and install the reviewed deploy script |
| Backups and a restore drill | M2 real-data gate | Approve the backup target; run the drill |
| Connect your Withings account and run `ownvitals probe` on the home server | M1 → INTEGRATION_VERIFIED | Run it; paste the shape-only output into the issue |
| Written clarification from Withings on Developer Agreement §4 and D2 (BYO, user cap) | M8 | Contact Withings |
| Human security review, legal checklist (§9.3), medical-claims review | M8 | Owner or a trusted reviewer |

## Assumptions (unverified; each needs the probe or the owner)

None recorded yet. M1 adds one row per Withings behaviour the code relies on but no real account
has confirmed (for example the `blocked_by_provider_plan` signal for post-13-Oct-2026 accounts).

## External dependencies

| Dependency | Pinned / state |
|---|---|
| classbeat platform source | `d80605100992f85f8f02672b9b5f885ed6166214` (ADR 0001) |
| Withings public API (`wbsapi.withings.net`) | documented behaviour in [withings-findings.md](withings-findings.md); unverified until the probe |
| GitHub-hosted runners | public repository, free minutes |

## Milestone acceptance evidence

Recorded here when a milestone's "done when" (PLAN §11) is checked: CI runs, test names, e2e
runs, and what remains unverified.
